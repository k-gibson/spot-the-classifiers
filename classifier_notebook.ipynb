    "For our final project, we were interested in how different song attributes affect song popularity. To do this, we used [this dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features). This dataset contained artist name, track id, track name, audio features, and popularity of over 116k songs on Spotify. There were thirteen audio features: acousticness, danceability, duration, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time signature, and valence. \n",
