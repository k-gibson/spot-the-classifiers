# Spot the Classifiers

This project implements multiple classifiers to predict song popularity based on song audio features. 
The data used in this project (can be found on Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features] and is from
the Spotify Web API.

## Motivation
Many popular songs tend to sound the same, but what exactly is the formula to success?
As avid Spotify users, we wanted to see whether song popularity can be accurately predicted based on its audio features alone.
